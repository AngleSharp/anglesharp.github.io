Yesterday a small hotfix release for AngleSharp v0.12 was released. With AngleSharp v0.12.1 also all the major libraries have been updated to v0.12.1 as well:

- AngleSharp.Xml
- AngleSharp.Io
- AngleSharp.Css
- AngleSharp.Js

The hotfix corrected the assembly version of AngleSharp, which was still delivered at 0.11. An update to the build script should prevent such issues in the future.

We used the hotfix to also deliver some smaller enhancements, such as additions to the `Accessors` flags or an improvement to the `TaskEventLoop`.

In AngleSharp.Css we could add some missing attributes. In AngleSharp.Xml we fixed the namespace for the `WithXml` from `AngleSharp.Xml` to `AngleSharp`.

We also updated most of the sample repositories. In the next release we will revamp the documentation.
