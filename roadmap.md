Roadmap
-------

The roadmap presents a draft on what is about to be implemented, and when. The priorities might change, which will affect the roadmap. Additionally the implementation speed will be impacted by factors like people participating in the project and design decisions.

The time estimates are speculative, which means that the project could be totally off those predictions. Finding talented (and motivated) collaborators would certainly speed up the project.

(July 2015) **0.9.0**

- (Simple?) XPath query support
- Interface for rendering defined
- CSS layout box
- Improved DOM algorithms and performance
- Parser token output
- More neat helpers
- CSS computation works with everything
- MathML support improved
- ShadowDOM 
- AngleSharp.Scripting with generated JS bindings

(End of 2015) **1.0.0**

- Final release of the first version
- MathML and SVG finalized (for HTML)
- HTML5 parser at 100% with complete DOM
- SVG document included
- SVG DOM skeleton implemented
- Most important SVG elements implemented

The current schedule seems to be rather defensive, which does not mean the project will be "finished", i.e. released in version 1.0.0, before the given date. If there is time left, more unit tests will be written and the general code quality will be increased.
