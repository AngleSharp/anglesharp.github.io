## Included Features

This section lists features that have been moved from the list of upcoming features to the implemented features. It does not include all available features, even though this may be the ultimate goal of this page. The purpose of moving the implemented features in here is to keep track of the used references. That way it should be easier to track W3C specification changes or if tests are missing.

### Mutation Records

There are types like `MutationObserver`, `MutationObserverInit` and `IMutationRecord` that have been implemented.

These types can act like generic notification listeners, that fire when something in the DOM changes. They would be also used internally by nodes, which may need to know when their content changes. As an example: The `HtmlStyleElement` needs to know when its content changes, since the new content has to be parsed and evaluated.

*Status*: Implemented, tests available.

* [WHATWG DOM Standard](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#mutation-observers)

### Provide Various Uri Implementations

An URI parser has been included within AngleSharp. This parser is nearly finished, but it does not do unicode normalization for the host part. This would be too heavy and should usually be provided by the .NET-Framework, however, for our PCL target it is not.

*Status*: Implemented, tests available.

* [WHATWG URL Standard](http://url.spec.whatwg.org/)
* [RFC3986 Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3986/)

### PseudoElement Integration

CSS provides several extensions to the DOM described in the HTML standard. One of these extensions is the integration of so-called pseudo elements. These elements do not really exist in the DOM, however, they can be queried and they are also part of the visual tree.

A pseudo element is not like a real element, and it only implements a special IDL, which will be called `IPseudoElement` in AngleSharp. Most importantly this interface implies the implementation of the `IGetStyleUtils` interface. So, even though a pseudo element is not a real element, it has the most important properties, which are required for being part of the drawing process.

*Status*: Minimal implementation provided. No tests yet.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C CSSOM PseudoElement](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#pseudoelement)
* [W3C CSS3 Selectors](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/)

### Extend the IWindow Interface

Central for any interaction with the DOM (at least from the perspective of a (JavaScript) developer) is the (root) context object, usually a `Window` object. AngleSharp uses the `IWindow` interface as IDL for such objects. Despite the available class `AnalysisWindow` in v0.7 AngleSharp does only provide a `Window` class implementation. It is much more general and may work together with the `RenderDevice` information.

The `Window` implementation also includes timers and more and can be really handy. It is quite crucial and used heavily from the browsing context. However, it is still possible to provide custom implementations.

*Status*: Minimal implementation provided. No tests yet.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C Window Module v1](http://www.w3.org/TR/Window/)
* [MDN Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)

* [WHATWG DOM Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-window-object)
* [Selection extension](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/editing/raw-file/tip/editing.html#dom-document-getselection)

### Event Handling

The ability to add or remove event listeners, along with the `dispatch` function have been included. What is also finished is the transformation of all .NET event handlers to their explicit form.

Consider the following example:

```cs
public event EventListener Aborted;
```

This is an implicit event handler. The C# compiler will create a backing delegate field, which will be initialized to `null`. The add += and remove parts -= will be used when these operators are applied on the `Aborted` field.

A transformation resulted in the following code:

```cs
public event EventListener Aborted
{
    add { AddEventListener(EventNames.Abort, value); }
    remove { RemoveEventListener(EventNames.Abort, value); }
}
```

Here the backing field is no longer generated. We explicitely define the add and remove methods, which will just call the `AddEventListener` / `RemoveEventListener` methods. The name of the event can be found at the MDN event reference. Usually it is the official DOM name, e.g., *onabort*, without the *on*-prefix.

This will be added to the `EventNames` class as a readonly static field:

```cs
public static readonly String Abort = "abort";
```

*Status*: Implemented, tests available.

### Rework Core DOM Algorithms

The core DOM algorithms have been implemented using MDN and W3C documentation. Nevertheless, it has been obvious, that some of these inner workings do not work as expected in edge cases. Therefore the WHATWG documentation will be considered, as it provides more detailed information with more related information.

As a side-effect the API will also be adapted partially. In the end this will not only be benifical from a standard compliance perspective, but also for users. Edge cases have to work not only within the HTML5 parser, but also during DOM interaction.

*Status*: Implemented, some tests available.

More information can be found at:

* [WHATWG DOM Standard](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)

### Browsing Context

Right now AngleSharp tries to be purely focused on doing a great job in parsing HTML (and CSS), however, at a later stage one might want to build more on top of this library. Therefore (and to be fully W3C conform), the ability to register / create / open a real browsing context is required.

A browsing context connects various parts. It contains a list with the (previous) documents and knows what document is currently viewed. It provides the `IWindowProxy` implementation, which forwards every call to the `IWindow` object of the currently active document.

Currently the specification is evaluated and a proper interface is planned. AngleSharp provides a very simple default implementation, which basically just holds the configuration to use.

*Status*: Minimal implementation provided. No tests yet.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C browsers spec.](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-html5-20130806/browsers.html#windows)
* [WHAT about browsing](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/browsers.html)

### Reshape CSS API

The HTML API has been completely reworked. Some of these principles have also been applied for CSS. Since there is nothing available in the official specification, it is hard to provide an API that does not conflict with the official one. Nevertheless, to make AngleSharp effective and useful for working with CSS, an object-oriented API is required.

Using just strings is useful in JavaScript, but not in a language like C# (or F#, VB, ...). We require the compiler to check rules, detect errors and help us by telling the IDE what methods and properties are available. Therefore a non-standard object-oriented API has been implemented, which sits directly on top of the CSSOM that is being used.

*Status*: Implemented, tests available.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C CSSOM](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#the-getstyleutils-interface)

### WebIDL Attributes

The Interface Definition Language (IDL) is used for describing the interfaces accessible from languages such as JavaScript. AngleSharp implements the named interface and algorithms. However, the naming has been changed (sometimes more, sometimes less). In order to automate wrapper generation for, e.g., JavaScript engines, and documentation generators, AngleSharp provides a custom attribute called `DomNameAttribute`. This attribute decorates methods, properties, types and more. Finally one is able to get the `OfficialName` by querying the corresponding `Type` instance.

There are more such attributes, which reveal more sophisticated properties of a member. An example would be if the method should actually be treated like an index getter or setter (or both). Maybe setting a property should be redirected to a property of the property. There are many specified actions, that are described in the official IDL language. Some of these are easy to deduce by using reflection, some might require the help of a custom attribute.

This work package deals with finding important IDL constructs. Then a proper way of dealing with them (e.g., decoration with a custom attribute) has to be found. Finally the existing interfaces need to investigated / extended, depending on what has been decided in the second step.

*Status*: Most important ones implemented, more to come upon request / requirement.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C WebIDL](http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/)

### Complete the IDocument Interface

The central node of a document is certainly the `IDocument` object itself. It is the owner of every attached node (directly or indirectly) and it has the connection to the `IWindow` object and the `IBrowsingContext` (only accessible internally), which has the `IConfiguration` instance attached.

Right now the `IDocument` interface is nearly complete and even includes some properties / methods that seem exotic at first. While some of these members do not contribute much (at least at the moment), others are certainly more interesting, especially in conjunction with scripting. One example is the `currentScript` property, which represents the currently executed `IHtmlScriptElement`.

Also the command API is implemented and can be connected via an available extension. All in all, the `IDocument` interface and its implemention (`Document`) can be said to be completely finished.

*Status*: Implemented, some tests available.

More information can be found at:

* [WHATWG Document Object](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#the-document-object)
* [MDN Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document)

### Improve Async Parsing

Asynchronous parsing is quite important. Even though standard (even large) processing may only take a few milliseconds, AngleSharp will also be used with sources that are (network) streams. There are two possible strategies: The first is to download everything before (asynchronous, and is an array of bytes), while the second is to continuously download data while processing the document. The latter has the advantage that even though the document may be long and the transfer may be broken at some point, at least parts of the document are already available.

The other advantage of the second approach is the possibility of starting other downloads, while the original one is still is progress. So instead of having one download after another, we have multiple downloads at once, which uses the available bandwidth even better.

AngleSharp will therefore try to implement the second approach. The `TextSource` class can already handle (network) streams well - and does use the "natively" provided asynchronous callback possibilities. Nevertheless, the `ParseAsync` method only relies on the synchronous one, wrapping it in another `Task` (which is just another `Thread` in this scenario).

The idea is to provide a real asynchronous method, i.e. a method that makes use of the async methods provided in `TextSource`. This will eventually result in a lot of copy / paste with only a few changes, but it is worth the duplication. Of course, some techniques to reduce duplication have to be used to minimize maintenance.

As an important hint here: Any `await` call should be only used with `ConfigureAwait(false)`. This is required to ensure that calling the method synchronously will not result in any deadlocks regardless of the environment.

*Status*: Implemented and the parser is also internally awaiting further tasks such as script execution or stylesheet resolution.

### The Picture Element

The picture element is the solution to responsive images and their problems. Images need to be adjusted for the pixel density and viewing device. The problem is, that the existing `HtmlImageElement` could only handle a single source. Now that changed due to the (not yet implemented) `srcset` and `sizes` attributes. The first one gives various sources along with their potential media queries. The latter is useful for setting the image size depending on the pixel density or width of the viewport.

However, if we want a more fine-grained solution than provided by the new `img`-attributes, then we should look at the `picture`-element. The element has been implemented in the `HtmlPictureElement` class, however, nothing has yet been included. A solution that might work just fine is to port the polyfill to the element. That solution would be a great start and could then be adjusted, if necessary.

*Status*: Element available, `srcset` attribute and `source` children are taken into account. Currently no device validation possible (part of CSS improvements for v1.0). Hence quasi static.

More information can be found at:

* [Article about srcset and sizes](http://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/)
* [Polyfill for picture](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/blob/master/src/picturefill.js)
* [WHATWG about Embedded Content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#embedded-content)
* [W3C Embedded Content specification](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#the-picture-element)

### Loading Resources

There is more to loading resources than meets the eye. Right now AngleSharp implements very rudimentary algorithms of fetching any external data. This will change in the future.

This change will align with more extensions (and probably constraints) for the `IBrowsingContext`. The browsing context is also from a security point of view crucial. Here the basic flags are set to determine what rights the underlying APIs may have. Another direct implication is to do the correct unloading of the document. This is not yet implemented.

*Status*: Simple implementations available, more sophisticated ones required. The sandboxing parsing is already implemented.

* [Sandboxing](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/browsers.html#sandboxing)

### Include Touch Events

There are several events in the DOM. Even though, some of these events are just plain notifications, others may transport custom data. In this group we find classics such as keyboard or mouse events. The W3C also created special touch events, which carry touch data in form of a list of touch points.

The purpose of this task is to supply all required interface, implementations and extension points to allow the creation and handling of touch events. This will extend the `IDocument`, `IElement` and other existing interfaces. This will also create new interfaces such as `ITouchEvent` or `ITouchList`.

There are no tricky algorithms, touch implementation or OS specific bindings to create. This is just the layer that allows creation of POD objects.

*Status*: Everything available.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C Touch events Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/)

## Upcoming Features

The GitHub project management features are definitely nice, but they do not provide enough space for discussion and an in-depth presentation of the upcoming features. This list is not ordered in any way (importance, time-to-release, ...) and should only be regarded as a collection of ideas and reminders.

### CSSOM View Module

Rendering might be one of the most interesting aspects of AngleSharp. AngleSharp won't cover rendering directly. Instead, it will be easy to hook up a custom rendering engine. A (sample) library will probably be provided, like with the AngleSharp.Scripting one, which serves as an example for including a JavaScript engine. One of the cornerstones of rendering is including the CSSOM view module, which specifies a lot of methods, interfaces and more. This will be crucial when connecting to a real device, such as a screen. Also fake devices, which might be used for analysis (see `Window`), profit from the CSSOM view module.

Not all interfaces and methods have to be implemented / provided by the core AngleSharp library. Instead one of the main tasks in this work package is to determine a good hierachy, which provides both, flexibility and information, which can be used for many purposes.

*Status*: Partially included. Most of these things will be determined once rendering (ext. library) is scratched.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C CSSOM](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/)

### Rendering

Okay, so here it is. There will be rendering, however, not directly within AngleSharp. However, to see what is (still) definitely required from a core perspective, a reference implementation has to be provided. This implementation should follow the official standard described in the CSS 2.1 specification and modules that arrived later.

*Status*: Sketched, outlined, but nothing happened so far.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C CSS 2.1 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/)
* [HTML Renderer project](https://github.com/ArthurHub/HTML-Renderer)
* [MDN Visual Formatting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Visual_formatting_model)

### Define UI Handling

Most of this section is an extension to `IWindow`. We require a few points:

* UI specific tree traversal, keeping track of styling
* The event loop (right now placed in `Document`)
* ...

Most of these things will be more obvious once a sample renderer implementation will be done and released. This will happen after v0.7, probably in October or more likely in November.

The core source should be a browsing context. This, however, is a point on its own. A browsing context will be superior to `IWindow` instances, which are tightly bound to `IDocument` instances. A browsing context will also carry the device information, which is currently available at the `IWindow` level.

*Status*: Completely missing.

### Finish Style Resolution

On a simple level the style resolution is already finished. However, with pseudo elements still missing, the `IWindow` being unfinished and other open questions, it is not possible to consider style resolution being solved.

In v0.7 there won't be any change (besides bugfixes and some minor feature updates) to the current status. First the CSS object model has to be refined / finished. Once the generated CSS tree is satisfying the style resolution will be on the list.

As a fact the style resolution is really important for (any) rendering project. Having style information is the most important thing for drawing the visual tree. In the end the visual tree is mostly based on the style information. The general rule is: Style + Text = presentation.

*Status*: Will be finished after the CSSOM is finished. This will likely happen for v1.0.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C DOM2 View](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSview-getComputedStyle)
* [W3C CSSOM getComputedStyle](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#dom-window-getcomputedstyle)
* [W3C CSSOM resolved values](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#resolved-values)

### Provide Further Extension Points

For instance an automatic file system buffer, which (obviously) requires access to the file system. Additionally storage might require access to the file system, but maybe in a different form. Also media types such as video, audio or image will require access to video and audio streaming / playing, as well as image displaying.

It is highly likely that v0.7 will already introduce some media extensions, such as gathering image or audio information (from raw bytes), or accessing the storage for the offline API. This will also introduce the extended configuration pipeline.

The extended configuration pipeline will be the core during DOM interaction. While the parser is the core during source parsing, the configuration pipeline contains all related data.

Already available are, e.g.:

* Style parsers
* Scripting engines
* HTTP requester

Missing among others are:

* Mime to media type
* Resource database
* Local storage

The ultimate goal is to have a multitude of extension points, which can then be fully customized, extended and used. This way AngleSharp stays quite atomic (parsers, DOM) and provides the abilities to grow (beyond local). A headless browser that is fully customizable and extensible.

*Status*: Available, more ideas needed.

### Possibility of (Simple?) XPath Parsing

Right now CSS selectors is the way of querying the document. Nevertheless, there are people who are quite dissatisfied with this solution. Most of those people are not web developers, and are familiar with even more powerful queries in the form of XPath. Unfortunately XPath is currently not support on a standard level.

It must be evaluated how much effort / code a XPath query engine (simple is enough, but it is has to be standard conform) requires. If it could be implemented with limited time efforts, then it should be included. Otherwise the possibility of including other / arbitrary query engines must be evaluated. In general this could be a very interesting path.

*Status*: Completely missing from core, some (external?) library such as `AngleSharp.XPath` makes sense.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C XPathEvaluator IDL](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathEvaluator)
* [W3C XPath Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/)

### MathML

MathML is a markup language that should allow writing equations like LaTeX. Therefore MathML has special tags, which carry a semantic meaning, such as being an operator, an identifier, a symbol, space, raw text and much more. HTML5 allows embedding of MathML by specification.

Right now AngleSharp can handle MathML as foreign elements in HTML. This is the way it should be. There are no plans to support "Math documents" or similar constructs. However, right now AngleSharp is limited to only a few MathML elements. All other elements will be regarded as a general `MathElement` element, with a custom `NodeName`.

There are several reasons to include more information on the MathML (sub) DOM. Therefore it is crucial to include all other specifically defined elements in AngleSharp. In the end the `MathFactory` has to be extended to also support these other elements. That should be sufficient to support MathML.

It has to be investigated if other properties, such as special entities, need to be included as well. If so, the question is: How to change the entity retrieval mode? There are several options, but the solution has to be robust, easy to extend, and well-performing.

*Status*: Basics included, shifted back to v1.0.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C MathML 3.0 TR](http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/)

### SVG

SVG is an XML based vector file format. HTML5 allows embedding SVG images in the document by specification. Some older browsers may require SVG images to be referenced (externally). AngleSharp supports HTML5 and therefore allows SVG to be included directly in the document.

Even though there are no plans for a "Math document", AngleSharp should consider having an "SVG document" in form of using the `IXmlDocument` interface (with the `XMLDocument` implementation). That way external SVG images can be parsed as well. It is yet unclear, if such documents will just use the HTML parser, or if the XML parser will be revived for this. If so it will be probably downgraded, to drop support for DTD and others. That way, the XML parser will be non-validating. This is probably the best solution.

There are lots of special elements and attributes, which need to be covered. In the end, however, this effort will be much less than implementing the HTML DOM.

*Status*: Basics included, shifted back to v1.0.

More information can be found at:

* [W3C SVG 1.1 TR](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/)

### Slimming AngleSharp

AngleSharp is not really giant, but it is continuously growing. While the project will never drop its core consisting of

* HTML parser,
* CSS parser,
* (Core) IDL interfaces,
* (Core) DOM implementation,
* configuration and extensions,

some of the contained abilities should be moved to other (extension) projects. Beginning with the completion of v0.8 a major evaluation will begin, to determine which parts are core / important and which are extensions. The main purpose of this evaluation will be:

* The keep AngleSharp small for small tasks
* To reduce the footprint
* Making AngleSharp even more extensible
* Providing extensions only if they are required

So if one includes AngleSharp just to parse a few lines of HTML, or a single HTML document, this task should be possible only with the core library. If one wants to make screenshots of webpages, emulate a full browsing context, or integrate JavaScript fully with AngleSharp (not just on top of a document), then the extensions are here to help.

In the end the idea is to give users only what they need, not more. If they want more, they can opt-in by getting more advanced NuGet packages, which work as extensions for the core library.

*Status*: CSS already moved out. More to come until v1.0.
