Like v0.11 this is only an intermediate release before becoming officially stable with v1.0. Obviously, I could now write a bit on the bugfixes, enhancements, and additions that come with this release. However, there is a bigger organizational change that has finally happend with the release of v0.12 ...</p>\n<p>... with this release AngleSharp is a member of the .NET Foundation. We will be supported with everything we need to sustain development on this project, bringing it to the next level and provide first-class web tooling to any .NET project. The vision of AngleSharp is now officially supported by the .NET Foundation!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The long term vision for AngleSharp is provide all the building blocks for downloading, inspecting, running, and rendering standard web assets within .NET applications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>AngleSharp is a .NET Browser Engine Core, which represents the basis for modern web tooling available to .NET applications in form of a .NET Standard library. This implies not only development time spent on AngleSharp itself, but also on related libraries and tools, e.g., Jint or Esprima.NET.</p>\n<p>The hope that comes with this organizational change is a bit of momentum to enhance the AngleSharp community. The vision is too large to be fulfilled by a few people - we need a strong community that desires and believes in strong web tooling for .NET.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the .NET Foundation for their support. Let's follow the journey towards outstanding web tooling in .NET together!</p>\n`;\n    const meta = {\"title\":\"Joining the .NET Foundation\",\"date\":\"2019-05-02 15:00:00\",\"categories\":\"news organization release\",\"author\":\"Florian Rappl\",\"userId\":\"FlorianRappl\",\"section\":\"Posts\"};\n  \n\nexport default () => (\n  <ContentPage>\n    \n    <PageLayout name={\"blog\"} meta={meta}>\n      <PageContent meta={meta}>\n        <Markdown content={html} link={link} editLabel={\"Edit on GitHub\"} />\n      </PageContent>\n    </PageLayout>\n  \n  </ContentPage>\n);"],"names":["meta","ContentPage","PageLayout","name","PageContent","Markdown","content","link","editLabel"],"sourceRoot":""}
