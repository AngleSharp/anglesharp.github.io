This release marks the v0.9 milestone. Besides providing skeleton implementations for, e.g., the recent shadow DOM API draft, the <code>picture</code> element, etc., this version fixes some bugs that may appear in conjunction with using scripts.</p>\n<p>Scripts are one of the success stories for AngleSharp. They make this library so useful. Therefore the AngleSharp.Scripting project is moving forward as well. The <em>AngleSharp.Scripting.JavaScript</em> library was yesterday released in with version 0.3. Here we will now try to align with the versioning of AngleSharp.Core.</p>\n<p>AngleSharp.Core will definitely be split up. The library is already too huge and contains too many features to be considered lightweight. Let's have a look at the SLOC (taken two months ago) of the DOM part alone:</p>\n<p><img src=\"${require(\"../../../../../../images/dist_dom.png\")}\" alt=\"AngleSharp Core DOM SLOC Distribution\"></p>\n<p>From this picture alone we can already estimate that splitting the library could be benificial. We have roughly 1/3 SLOC spent on general, HTML and CSS functionality. The splitting could therefore result in three or four parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>AngleSharp.Core.Common</em>, containing the basic infrastructure and definitions [no dependency]</li>\n<li><em>AngleSharp.Core.Html</em>, containing the HTML parser and DOM implementation [depending on Common]</li>\n<li><em>AngleSharp.Core.Css</em>, containing the CSS parser and CSSOM implementation [depending on Common]</li>\n<li><em>AngleSharp.Core.Complete</em>, aggregating the Core and providing further helpers [depending on the former three]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experiments with a proper dissection will begin soon. Also the renderer part will then be discussed. Plans have already been made and it seems likely that a renderer will be published within this year (experimental stage). Here a new project, AngleSharp.Renderer will be opened. The renderer itself will contain many libraries, specifically to make the renderer common infrastructure a PCL again with specific platform libraries that contain the actual drawing code.</p>\n`;\n    const meta = {\"title\":\"AngleSharp v0.9 released\",\"date\":\"2015-08-27 14:05:00\",\"categories\":\"news release\",\"author\":\"Florian Rappl\",\"userId\":\"FlorianRappl\",\"section\":\"Posts\"};\n  \n\nexport default () => (\n  <ContentPage>\n    \n    <PageLayout name={\"blog\"} meta={meta}>\n      <PageContent meta={meta}>\n        <Markdown content={html} link={link} editLabel={\"Edit on GitHub\"} />\n      </PageContent>\n    </PageLayout>\n  \n  </ContentPage>\n);","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"5ba40af84b557dfb645c3a294324c1ed.png\";"],"names":["html","meta","ContentPage","PageLayout","name","PageContent","Markdown","content","link","editLabel","module","exports"],"sourceRoot":""}
