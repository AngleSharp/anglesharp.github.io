Besides a few bug fixes the <code>CompareDocumentPosition</code> method has been improved. It now passes all tests and works reliably.</p>\n<p>The most interesting new feature is the ability to define custom handling of entities. This can be done via the <code>IEntityService</code>. The <code>GetSymbol</code> is usually called with an entity like <code>gt</code> for XML or <code>gt;</code> for HTML. The difference between XML and HTML lies in the way that HTML handles entity errors. HTML has the possibility to use non-semicolon-terminated entities.</p>\n<p>The simplest way would be to use, e.g., <code>XmlEntityService.Resolver</code>, in a custom implementation. That way the common entities would be resolved by the already available service.</p>\n<p>The next release will most probably be a feature release again. Hopefully features such as the CSSOM improvements, factory extensions, or a virtual file system, will be integrated.</p>\n",link:"https://github.com/AngleSharp/anglesharp.github.io/tree/main/docs/blog/2015-10-12-anglesharp-v093-released.md",editLabel:"Edit on GitHub"}))))}}}]);
