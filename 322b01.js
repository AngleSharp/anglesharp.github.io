Like v0.11 this is only an intermediate release before becoming officially stable with v1.0. Obviously, I could now write a bit on the bugfixes, enhancements, and additions that come with this release. However, there is a bigger organizational change that has finally happend with the release of v0.12 ...</p>\n<p>... with this release AngleSharp is a member of the .NET Foundation. We will be supported with everything we need to sustain development on this project, bringing it to the next level and provide first-class web tooling to any .NET project. The vision of AngleSharp is now officially supported by the .NET Foundation!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The long term vision for AngleSharp is provide all the building blocks for downloading, inspecting, running, and rendering standard web assets within .NET applications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>AngleSharp is a .NET Browser Engine Core, which represents the basis for modern web tooling available to .NET applications in form of a .NET Standard library. This implies not only development time spent on AngleSharp itself, but also on related libraries and tools, e.g., Jint or Esprima.NET.</p>\n<p>The hope that comes with this organizational change is a bit of momentum to enhance the AngleSharp community. The vision is too large to be fulfilled by a few people - we need a strong community that desires and believes in strong web tooling for .NET.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the .NET Foundation for their support. Let's follow the journey towards outstanding web tooling in .NET together!</p>\n",link:"https://github.com/AngleSharp/anglesharp.github.io/tree/main/docs/blog/2019-05-02-dotnet-foundation.md",editLabel:"Edit on GitHub"}))))}}}]);
