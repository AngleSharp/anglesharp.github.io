What is AngleSharp?
-------------

AngleSharp is a .NET library that gives you the ability to parse angle bracket based hyper-texts like HTML, SVG, and MathML. In the future XML might be included, however, since .NET offers a variety of capable XML parsers there is a discussion about redundancy. An important aspect of AngleSharp is that CSS can also be parsed. The parser is built upon the official W3C specification. This produces a perfectly portable HTML5 DOM representation of the given source code. Also current features such as `querySelector` or `querySelectorAll` work for tree traversal.

The advantage over similar libraries like the HtmlAgilityPack is that e.g. CSS (including selectors) is already built-in. Also the parser uses the HTML 5.1 specification, which defines error handling and element correction. While the HtmlAgilityPack focuses on giving .NET users a nice and easy way to handle HTML documents, this library focuses on giving web developers working with C# all possibilities as they would have in a browser using JavaScript. Hence the DOM is built in a more reliable, standard-conform and faster way than with the other solutions.

The performance of AngleSharp is quite close to the performance of browsers. Even very large pages can be processed within milliseconds. AngleSharp tries to minimize memory allocations and reuses elements internally to avoid unnecessary object creation.

The project aims to bring a solid implementation of the W3C DOM for HTML, SVG, MathML and CSS to the CLR, written in C#. The idea is that you can basically do everything with the DOM in C# that you can do in JavaScript.

Most parts of the DOM are included, even though some may still miss their (right) implementation. The goal for v1.0 is to have almost everything implemented according to the official W3C specification (with useful extensions by the WHATWG).

The API is close to the DOM4 specification, however, the naming has been adjusted to apply with .NET conventions. Nevertheless, to make AngleSharp really useful for, e.g., a JavaScript engine, attributes have been placed on the corresponding interfaces (and methods, properties, ...) to indicate the status of the field in the official specification. This allows automatic generation of DOM objects with the official API.

This is a long-term project which will eventually result in a state of the art parser for the most important angle bracket based hyper-texts (and related description languages like CSS).

**Update** With version v0.8.0 further refactorings have been applied. The namespace `AngleSharp.DOM` (and sub-namespaces) has been modified. The new name `AngleSharp.Dom` fits much better into the .NET naming scheme.

**Update** With version v0.6.0 the new API has been published. This API seems to be much cleaner and more extensible than the previous one. It also separates the implementation from the specification, which is important for working with the API, as new changes are less likely to break existing code (API usage). Most API changes have also been included to mainly reflect DOM4, with some (obsolete) parts being removed.

Roadmap
-------

The roadmap presents a draft on what is about to be implemented, and when. The priorities might change, which will affect the roadmap. Additionally the implementation speed will be impacted by factors like people participating in the project and design decisions.

The time estimates are speculative, which means that the project could be totally off those predictions. Finding talented (and motivated) collaborators would certainly speed up the project.

(April 2015) **0.9.0**

- (Simple?) XPath query support
- Interface for rendering defined
- CSS layout box
- Improved DOM algorithms and performance
- Parser token output
- More neat helpers
- CSS computation works with everything
- MathML support improved
- ShadowDOM 
- AngleSharp.Scripting with generated JS bindings

(September 2015) **1.0.0**

- Final release of the first version
- MathML and SVG finalized (for HTML)
- HTML5 parser at 100% with complete DOM
- SVG document included
- SVG DOM skeleton implemented
- Most important SVG elements implemented

The current schedule seems to be rather defensive, which does not mean the project will be "finished", i.e. released in version 1.0.0, before the given date. If there is time left, more unit tests will be written and the general code quality will be increased.

Use-cases
---------

- Parsing HTML (incl. fragments)
- Parsing CSS (incl. selectors, declarations, ...)
- Constructing HTML (e.g., view-engine)
- Minifying CSS, HTML
- Querying document elements
- Crawling information
- Gathering statistics
- Connection to page analytics
- HTML / DOM Unit Tests
- Automated JavaScript interaction
- Testing other script engines
- ...

Participating in the project
----------------------------

If you know some feature that AngleSharp is currently missing, and you are willing to implement the feature, then your contribution is more than welcome! Also if you have a really cool idea - do not be shy, we'd like to hear it.

If you have an idea how to improve the API (or what is missing) then posts / messages are also welcome. For instance there have been ongoing discussions about some styles that have been used by AngleSharp (e.g. `HTMLDocument` instead of `HtmlDocument`) in the past. In the end AngleSharp stopped using `HTMLDocument` (at least visible outside of the library). Now AngleSharp uses names like `IDocument`, `IHtmlElement` and so on. This change would not have been possible without fruitful discussions.

The project is always searching for additional contributors. Even if you do not have any code to contribute, but rather an idea for improvement, a bug report or a mistake in the documentation. These are the contributions that keep this project active.
